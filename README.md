### About
I'm really happy to be releasing a full-ish "game," even if it's for a game jam and the game design is not really my own. I am employed full-time as a software developer and make games as a hobby. Since about two months ago, I've been learning Unity and religiously working on games from about 5:30am to 7:30am each morning. I didn't record my time, but I'll estimate that I clocked about 24 hours on this game. I'm pretty proud of myself for what I was able to accomplish under a time crunch!

I may continue to work on it as well, but will publish to a separate page so that this particular form of the game will be preserved for posterity. If you're a designer, artist or musician and would like to work on games together, please reach out! I'd love to work with other talented folks and make better games.

Special thanks to my daughter Amalie, who helped me considerably with making good-looking tiny pixel art. And thanks to both Amalie and Elise for providing much need encouragement.

Also, shout out to the instructors from [gamedev.tv](https://www.gamedev.tv/) and [Udemy](). Taking those courses helped me to quickly learn the basics of Unity. I recommend them to anyone who wants to learn to make games.
